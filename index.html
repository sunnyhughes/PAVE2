    <div id="mission">
        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to engage, empower and equip parents with the necessary skills and resources to strengthen family connectedness and to reduce the rate of violence among youth and young adults
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="history">
        <h2>About (History)</h2>
        <p>In 2021, a group of parents and other concerned individuals with a background in services, came together to create a strategy with the goal to address the violence among our youth and young adults. The Baptist Fellowship Center in Louisville, KY serves as the fiscal sponsor of PAVE and provides meeting and program space along with the management of resources and access to operating support services.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="goals">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to increase positive self-image through involving parents in activities and classes to teach them how to resolve conflict with violence in hopes that they will circulate what they have learned to their children and others in the community
        </p>
       </div>

    <div id="strategy">
        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>We know that the close relationship’s in a person’s life can either increase or reduce the risk of experiencing violence as a victim or a perpetrator. A young person’s closest social circle--peers, partner’s and family members--influences their behaviors and contributes to their experience. Risk factors at the family level include: authoritarian childrearing attitudes, low parental involvement, poor family functioning, and parental substance abuse or history of criminal involvement. Peer and social risk factors include involvement in gangs and social rejections by peers.</p>

        <p>PAVE’s strategic approach will strengthen parental and family connectedness through a 12-step method or 12 months group learning opportunities, monthly positive family activities ad events as well as through peer-to-peer discussion sessions</p>
            
        <p> PAVE will partner with organizations and individuals to engage 20-25 parents(per site) annually and provide a 12 month cycle of activities that address 12 topics.</p>
